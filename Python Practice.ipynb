In other words, we can say that local variables are accessible only inside the function in which it was initialized whereas the global variables are accessible throughout the program and inside every function. \n\nRules of global keyword:\n----------------------------\n    If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.\n    Variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.\n    We Use global keyword to use a global variable inside a function.\n    There is no need to use global keyword outside a function.\nUse of global keyword: To access a global variable inside a function there is no need to use global keyword.\n\nIf we need to assign a new value to a global variable then we can do that by declaring the variable as global.\nIf we try to assign a new value without global keyword, Interpreter throws error - \"UnboundLocalError: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment\"\n\nGlobal variables across python modules :\n----------------------------------------\nThe best way to share global variables across different modules within the same program is to create a special module (often named config or cfg). Import the config module in all modules of your application; the module then becomes available as a global name. There is only one instance of each module and so any changes made to the module object get reflected everywhere.\n\n\nLocal Variables:\n--------------------\nLocal variables are those which are initialized inside a function and belongs only to that particular function. It cannot be accessed anywhere outside the function. Let’s see how to create a local variable.\n\n",

      "source": "*********** For Loops ***********\n\nPython For loop is used for sequential traversal i.e. it is used for iterating over an iterable like string, tuple, list, etc. It falls under the category of definite iteration. Definite iterations mean the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance. In Python, there is no C style for loop, i.e., for (i=0; i<n; i++). There is “for in” loop which is similar to for each loop in other languages.\n\nNote: In Python, for loops only implements the collection-based iteration.\n\nSyntax:\n\nfor var in iterable:\n    # statements\n    \n# Loop Control Statements:\n--------------------------\nLoop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. Python supports the following control statements.\n\n# Continue Statement: Python continue Statement returns the control to the beginning of the loop.\n\n# Break Statement:Python break statement brings control out of the loop.\n\n# Pass Statement: The pass statement to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statements, functions, and classes.\n\n# range() function:\n-------------------\nPython range() is a built-in function that is used when a user needs to perform an action a specific number of times. range() in Python(3.x) is just a renamed version of a function called xrange() in Python(2.x). The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Depending on how many arguments user is passing to the function, user can decide where that series of numbers will begin and end as well as how big the difference will be between one number and the next.range() takes mainly three arguments. \n\nstart: integer starting from which the sequence of integers is to be returned\nstop: integer before which the sequence of integers is to be returned. The range of integers end at stop – 1.\nstep: integer value which determines the increment between each integer in the sequence \n\n\nPython for loop with else:\n------------------------------\nIn most of the programming languages (C/C++, Java, etc), the use of else statements has been restricted with the if conditional statements. But Python also allows us to use the else condition with for loops. \n\nNote: The else block just after for/while is executed only when the loop is NOT terminated by a break statement ",

      "source": "************** While Loop ************\nPython While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed. While loop falls under the category of indefinite iteration. Indefinite iteration means that the number of times the loop is executed isn’t specified explicitly in advance. \n\nSyntax: \n\nwhile expression:\n    statement(s)\n    \nSingle statement while block:\n----------------------------\nJust like the if block, if the while block consists of a single statement we can declare the entire loop in a single line. If there are multiple statements in the block that makes up the loop body, they can be separated by semicolons (;). \n\nWhile loop with else:\n----------------------\nAs discussed above, while loop executes the block until a condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the statement immediately after the loop is executed. The else clause is only executed when your while condition becomes false. If you break out of the loop, or if an exception is raised, it won’t be executed.\n\nNote: The else block just after for/while is executed only when the loop is NOT terminated by a break statement. \n\nSentinel Controlled Statement:\n-------------------------------\nIn this, we don’t use any counter variable because we don’t know that how many times the loop will execute. Here user decides that how many times he wants to execute the loop. For this, we use a sentinel value. A sentinel value is a value that is used to terminate a loop whenever a user enters it, generally, the sentinel value is -1.",

      "source": "Looping Techniques in Python:\n------------------------------\nPython supports various looping techniques by certain inbuilt functions, in various sequential containers. These methods are primarily very useful in competitive programming and also in various projects which require a specific technique with loops maintaining the overall structure of code.  A lot of time and memory space is been saved as there is no need to declare the extra variables which we declare in the traditional approach of loops.\n\nWhere they are used?\nDifferent looping techniques are primarily useful in the places where we don’t need to actually manipulate the structure and order of the overall containers, rather only print the elements for a single-use instance, no in-place change occurs in the container. This can also be used in instances to save time.\n\nDifferent looping techniques using Python data structures  are: \n\nUsing enumerate():  enumerate() is used to loop through the containers printing the index number along with the value present in that particular index.\n\nUsing zip(): zip() is used to combine 2 similar containers(list-list or dict-dict) printing the values sequentially. The loop exists only till the \nsmaller container ends.\n\nUsing iteritem(): iteritems() is used to loop through the dictionary printing the dictionary key-value pair sequentially which is used before Python 3 version.\n\nUsing items(): items() performs the similar task on dictionary as iteritems() but have certain disadvantages when compared with iteritems().\n    It is very time-consuming. Calling it on large dictionaries consumes quite a lot of time.\n    It takes a lot of memory. Sometimes takes double the memory when called on a dictionary.\n\nUsing sorted():  sorted() is used to print the container is sorted order. It doesn’t sort the container but just prints the container in sorted order for 1 instance. The use of set() can be combined to remove duplicate occurrences.\n\nUsing reversed(): reversed() is used to print the values of the container in the reversed order. It does not reflect any changes to the original list.\n\nThese techniques are quick to use and reduce coding effort. for, while loops need the entire structure of the container to be changed.\nThese Looping techniques do not require any structural changes to the container. They have keywords that present the exact purpose of usage. Whereas, no pre-predictions or guesses can be made in for, while loop i.e not easily understand the purpose at a glance.\nLooping technique makes the code more concise than using for & while looping.\n",

      "source": "************************ FUNCTIONS *******************\nPython Functions is a block of related statements designed to perform a computational, logical, or evaluative task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. \n\nFunctions can be both built-in or user-defined. It helps the program to be concise, non-repetitive, and organized.\n\nSyntax: \n\ndef function_name(parameters):\n    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n    statement(s)\n    return expression\n    \nArguments of a Function: Arguments are the values passed inside the parenthesis of the function. A function can have any number of arguments separated by a comma.\n\nTypes of Arguments:\n---------------------------\n1. Default arguments : A default argument is a parameter that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument. \n\n2. Keyword arguments : The idea is to allow the caller to specify the argument name with values so that caller does not need to remember the order of parameters.\n\n3. Variable-length arguments : In Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:\n    *args (Non-Keyword Arguments)\n    **kwargs (Keyword Arguments) :\n        We use the name kwargs with the double star. The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).\n\n        A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.\n        One can think of the kwargs as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it. That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesn’t seem to be any order in which they were printed out.\n\nDocstring:\n------------------\nThe first string after the function is called the Document string or Docstring in short. This is used to describe the functionality of the function. The use of docstring in functions is optional but it is considered a good practice.\n\nThe below syntax can be used to print out the docstring of a function:\nSyntax: print(function_name.__doc__)\n\nThe return statement:\n--------------------------\nThe function return statement is used to exit from a function and go back to the function caller and return the specified value or data item to the caller.\n\nSyntax: return [expression_list]\n\nThe return statement can consist of a variable, an expression, or a constant which is returned to the end of the function execution. If none of the above is present with the return statement a None object is returned.\n\nIs Python Function Pass by Reference or pass by value? \n------------------------------------------------------\nOne important thing to note is, in Python every variable name is a reference. When we pass a variable to a function, a new reference to the object is created. Parameter passing in Python is the same as reference passing in Java.\nNote: When we pass a reference and change the received reference to something else, the connection between the passed and received parameter is broken.\n\n\nAnonymous functions:\n-----------------------\nIn Python, an anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know the def keyword is used to define the normal functions and the lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions.\n\nSyntax: \n    lambda arguments: expression\n\n    * This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.\n    * One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.\n    * You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.\n    * It has various uses in particular fields of programming besides other types of expressions in functions.\n\nPython Function within Functions:\n----------------------------------\nA function that is defined inside another function is known as the inner function or nested function. Nested functions are able to access variables of the enclosing scope. Inner functions are used so that they can be protected from everything happening outside the function.\n\n\n# Yield Statement:\n------------------------\nThe yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list.\n\nReturn sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don’t want to store the entire sequence in memory.\n\nYield are used in Python generators. A Generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.\n\nThere are two terms involved when we discuss generators.\n\n1. Generator-Function : A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.\n\n2. Generator-Object : Generator functions return a generator object. Generator objects are used either by calling the next method on the generator object or using the generator object in a “for in” loop (as shown in the above program).\n\nApplications : Suppose we to create a stream of Fibonacci numbers, adopting the generator approach makes it trivial; we just have to call next(x) to get the next Fibonacci number without bothering about where or when the stream of numbers ends.\nA more practical type of stream processing is handling large data files such as log files. Generators provide a space efficient method for such data processing as only parts of the file are handled at one given point in time. We can also use Iterators for these purposes, but Generator provides a quick way (We don’t need to write __next__ and __iter__ methods here).\n\n\n# First Class Functions in Python:\n--------------------------------\nFirst class objects in a language are handled uniformly throughout. They may be stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or used in control structures. A programming language is said to support first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class objects. Python supports the concept of First Class functions.\n\nProperties of first class functions:\n    1. A function is an instance of the Object type: \n        Python functions are first class objects. In the example below, we are assigning function to a variable. This assignment doesn’t call the  function. It takes the function object referenced by shout and creates a second name pointing to it, yell.\n    \n    2. You can store the function in a variable.\n    \n    3. You can pass the function as a parameter to another function: \n        Because functions are objects we can pass them as arguments to other functions. Functions that can accept other functions as arguments are also called higher-order functions. In the example below, we have created a function greet which takes a function as an argument.\n    \n    4. You can return the function from a function: \n        Because functions are objects we can return a function from another function.\n    \n    5. You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, …\n    \n# Python Closures:\n--------------------\nA Closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory. \n\n1. It is a record that stores a function together with an environment: a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created.\n\n2. A closure—unlike a plain function—allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure’s copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.\n\nWhen and why to use Closures:\n1. As closures are used as callback functions, they provide some sort of data hiding. This helps us to reduce the use of global variables.\n2. When we have few functions in our code, closures prove to be an efficient way. But if we need to have many functions, then go for class (OOP).\n\n# Decorators:\nDecorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.\n\nIn Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.\n\nSyntax for Decorator: \n\n@gfg_decorator\ndef hello_decorator():\n    print(\"Gfg\")\n\n'''Above code is equivalent to -\n\ndef hello_decorator():\n    print(\"Gfg\")\n    \nhello_decorator = gfg_decorator(hello_decorator)'''\n\nIn the above code, gfg_decorator is a callable function, will add some code on the top of some another callable function, hello_decorator function and return the wrapper function.\n\n\nThe syntax for decorators with parameters :\n@decorator(params)\ndef func_name():\n    ''' Function implementation'''\n    \nThe above code is equivalent to \n\ndef func_name():\n    ''' Function implementation'''\n\nfunc_name = (decorator(params))(func_name)\n\"\"\"\n\nAs the execution starts from left to right decorator(params) is called which returns a function object fun_obj. Using the fun_obj the call fun_obj(fun_name) is made. Inside the inner function, required operations are performed and the actual function reference is returned which will be assigned to func_name. Now, func_name() can be used to call the function with decorator applied on it.\n\nMemoization using decorators in Python:\n---------------------------------------\nRecursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly till a termination condition is met. Some of the examples where recursion is used are: calculation of fibonacci series, factorial etc. But the issue with them is that in the recursion tree, there can be chances that the sub-problem that is already solved is being solved again, which adds to an overhead.\n\nMemoization is a technique of recording the intermediate results so that it can be used to avoid repeated calculations and speed up the programs. It can be used to optimize the programs that use recursion. In Python, memoization can be done with the help of function decorators. ",

We can also put a lambda definition anywhere a function is expected, and we don’t have to assign it to a variable at all.

Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n\nClass creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.\n\nSome points on Python class: \n    Classes are created by keyword class.\n    Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.\n    Attributes are always public by default and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute\n\nClass Definition Syntax:\n\n    class ClassName:\n        # Statement-1\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        # Statement-N\n\nClass Objects:\n--------------\nAn Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. It’s not an idea anymore, it’s an actual dog, like a dog of breed pug who’s seven years old. You can have many dogs to create many different instances, but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.\n\nAn object consists of : \n    State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\n    Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n    Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.\n    \nDeclaring Objects (Also called instantiating a class):\nWhen an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances.\n\nThe self:\n-----------\nClass methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.\nIf we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.\nThis is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.\nWhen we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) – this is all the special self is about.\n\n\n__init__ method: (Constructors)\n-----------------\nThe __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n\nSyntax of constructor declaration : \n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # body of the constructor\n\nTypes of constructors : \n\n1. default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesn’t accept any arguments. Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.\n\n2. parameterized constructor: constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.\n\nDestructors:\n------------\n\nDestructors are called when an object gets destroyed. In Python, destructors are not needed as much as in C++ because Python has a garbage collector that handles memory management automatically. \nThe __del__() method is a known as a destructor method in Python. It is called when all references to the object have been deleted i.e when an object is garbage collected. \n\nSyntax of destructor declaration : \n\n    def __del__(self):\n      # body of destructor\n\nNote : A reference to objects is also deleted when the object goes out of reference or when the program ends. \n\nClass and Instance Variables:\n-----------------------------\nInstance variables are for data, unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class. Instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self whereas class variables are variables whose value is assigned in the class.\n\nDefining instance variable using a constructor. \n\n\n# Inheritance in Python:\n-----------------------\n\nInheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The benefits of inheritance are: \n    \n    1. It represents real-world relationships well.\n    2. It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n    3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n\nWhat is object class? \nLike Java Object class, in Python (from version 3.x), object is root of all classes. \nIn Python 3.x, “class Test(object)” and “class Test” are same. \nIn Python 2.x, “class Test(object)” creates a class with object as parent (called new style class) and “class Test” creates old style class (without object parent). \n\nSubclassing (Calling constructor of parent class):\nA child class needs to identify which class is its parent class. This can be done by mentioning the parent class name in the definition of the child class. \n    Eg: class subclass_name (superclass_name): \n    _ _ _ \n    _ _ _ \n    \nDifferent forms of Inheritance: \n\n    1. Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance.\n\n    2. Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritance. \n    Unlike java, python shows multiple inheritance.\n\n    3. Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship.\n\n    4. Hierarchical inheritance More than one derived classes are created from a single base.\n\n    5. Hybrid inheritance: This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of more than one type of inheritance.\n\nPrivate members of parent class:\n---------------------------------\nWe don’t always want the instance variables of the parent class to be inherited by the child class i.e. we can make some of the instance variables of the parent class private, which won’t be available to the child class. \nWe can make an instance variable by adding double underscores before its name.\n\n\n# Encapsulation:\n-------------------\n\nEncapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n\nA class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.\n\nProtected members:\n-------------------\nProtected members (in C++ and JAVA) are those members of the class that cannot be accessed outside the class but can be accessed from within the class and its subclasses. To accomplish this in Python, just follow the convention by prefixing the name of the member by a single underscore “_”.\n\nAlthough the protected variable can be accessed out of the class as well as in the derived class(modified too in derived class), it is customary(convention not a rule) to not access the protected out the class body.\n\nNote: The __init__ method is a constructor and runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. \n\nPrivate members:\n-----------------\nPrivate members are similar to protected members, the difference is that the class members declared private should neither be accessed outside the class nor by any base class. In Python, there is no existence of Private instance variables that cannot be accessed except inside a class.\n\nHowever, to define a private member prefix the member name with double underscore “__”.\n\nNote: Python’s private and protected members can be accessed outside the class through python name mangling. \n\nMangling and how it works?\n--------------------------\n\nIn Python, there is something called name mangling, which means that there is limited support for a valid use-case for class-private members basically to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses. Any identifier of the form __geek (at least two leading underscores or at most one trailing underscore) is replaced with _classname__geek, where classname is the current class name with a leading underscore(s) stripped. As long as it occurs within the definition of the class, this mangling is done. This is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls. \n\nThe mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents but it is still possible to access or modify a variable that is considered private. This can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in the debugger.\n \n_Single Leading Underscores: \n    So basically one underline at the beginning of a method, function, or data member means you shouldn’t access this method because it’s not part of the API.\n\n__Double Leading Underscores:\n    Two underlines, in the beginning, cause a lot of confusion. This is about syntax rather than a convention. double underscore will mangle the attribute names of a class to avoid conflicts of attribute names between classes.\n    \n__Double leading and Double trailing underscores__ :\nThere’s another case of double leading and trailing underscores. We follow this while using special variables or methods (called “magic method”) such as__len__, __init__. These methods provide special syntactic features to the names. For example, __file__ indicates the location of the Python file, __eq__ is executed when a == b expression is executed. \n\n\n# PolyMorphism:\n------------------\n    The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.\n\nPolymorphism with class methods: \n    The below code shows how Python can use two different class types, in the same way. We create a for loop that iterates through a tuple of objects. Then call the methods without being concerned about which class type each object is. We assume that these methods actually exist in each class. \n\nPolymorphism with Inheritance: \n    In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding. \n    \nPolymorphism with a Function and objects: \n    It is also possible to create a function that can take any object, allowing for polymorphism. In this example, let’s create a function called “func()” which will take an object which we will name “obj”. Though we are using the name ‘obj’, any instantiated object will be able to be called into this function. Next, let’s give the function something to do that uses the ‘obj’ object we passed to it. In this case, let’s call the three methods, viz., capital(), language() and type(), each of which is defined in the two classes ‘India’ and ‘USA’. Next, let’s create instantiations of both the ‘India’ and ‘USA’ classes if we don’t have them already. With those, we can call their action using the same func() function\n    \n# Class or Static Variables in Python:\n-------------------------------------\n    All objects share class or static variables. An instance or non-static variables are different for different objects (every object has a copy). For example, let a Computer Science Student be represented by class CSStudent. The class may have a static variable whose value is “cse” for all objects. And class may also have non-static members like name and roll. In C++ and Java, we can use static keywords to make a variable a class variable. The variables which don’t have a preceding static keyword are instance variables. See this for the Java example and this for the C++ example.\n\nThe Python approach is simple; it doesn’t require a static keyword. \n\nAll variables which are assigned a value in the class declaration are class variables. And variables that are assigned values inside methods are instance variables.\n\n# Class method vs Static method in Python:\n===========================================\nClass Method:\n--------------\n    The @classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. \nA class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance \nSyntax: \n\nclass C(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def fun(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):\n       ....\nfun: function that needs to be converted into a class method\nreturns: a class method for function.\n\n    * A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.\n    * They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.\n    * It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example, it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.\n \nStatic Method:\n----------------\n    A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.\n\nSyntax: \n\nclass C(object):\n    @staticmethod\n    def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):\n        ...\nreturns: a static method for function fun.\n\n    * A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.\n    * A static method can’t access or modify the class state.\n    * It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.\n    \nClass method vs Static Method:\n-------------------------------\n1. A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n2. A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can’t access or modify it.\n3. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.\n4. We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.\n\nWhen to use what?\n-------------------\n1. We generally use class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.\n2. We generally use static methods to create utility functions.\n\nHow to define a class method and a static method?\n--------------------------------------------------\n    To define a class method in python, we use @classmethod decorator, and to define a static method we use @staticmethod decorator. \nLet us look at an example to understand the difference between both of them. Let us say we want to create a class Person. Now, python doesn’t support method overloading like C++ or Java so we use class methods to create factory methods. \n\n\n# Abstract Classes in Python:\n==============================\n\nAn abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class. \n  \nWhy use Abstract Base Classes : \nBy defining an abstract base class, you can define a common Application Program Interface(API) for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially useful in situations where a third-party is going to provide implementations, such as with plugins, but can also help you when working in a large team or with a large code-base where keeping all classes in your mind is difficult or not possible. \n  \nHow Abstract Base classes work : \nBy default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base. A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod. \n\nImplementation Through Subclassing : \nBy subclassing directly from the base, we can avoid the need to register the class explicitly. In this case, the Python class management is used to recognize PluginImplementation as implementing the abstract PluginBase. \n\nA side-effect of using direct subclassing is, it is possible to find all the implementations of your plugin by asking the base class for the list of known classes derived from it. \n\nConcrete Methods in Abstract Base Classes : \n-----------------------------------------\nConcrete classes contain only concrete (normal)methods whereas abstract classes may contain both concrete methods and abstract methods. The concrete class provides an implementation of abstract methods, the abstract base class can also provide an implementation by invoking the methods via super(). \n\nAbstract Properties : \nAbstract classes include attributes in addition to methods, you can require the attributes in concrete classes by defining them with @abstractproperty. \n \nAbstract Class Instantiation : \nAbstract classes are incomplete because they have methods that have nobody. If python allows creating an object for abstract classes then using that object if anyone calls the abstract method, but there is no actual implementation to invoke. So we use an abstract class as a template and according to the need, we extend it and build on it before we can use it. Due to the fact, an abstract class is not a concrete class, it cannot be instantiated. When we create an object for the abstract class it raises an error. \n\n",

Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program. \n\nTwo types of Error occurs in python.  \n    1. Syntax errors\n    2. Logical errors (Exceptions) \n\nDifference between Syntax Error and Exceptions:\n--------------------------------------------------\nSyntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code. It leads to the termination of the program. \n\nExceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.\n\nNote: Exception is the base class for all the exceptions in Python.\n\nTry and Except Statement – Catching Exceptions:\n===============================================\nTry and except statements are used to catch and handle exceptions in Python. Statements that can raise exceptions are kept inside the try clause and the statements that handle the exception are written inside except clause.\n\nCatching Specific Exception:\n    A try statement can have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for different exceptions. Please note that at most one handler will be executed. For example, we can add IndexError in the above code. The general syntax for adding specific exceptions are – \n\n    try:\n        # statement(s)\n    except IndexError:\n        # statement(s)\n    except ValueError:\n        # statement(s)\n\nHow try() works? \n\n    First, the try clause is executed i.e. the code between try and except clause.\n    If there is no exception, then only the try clause will run, except the clause is finished.\n    If any exception occurs, the try clause will be skipped and except clause will run.\n    If any exception occurs, but the except clause within the code doesn’t handle it, it is passed on to the outer try statements. If the exception is left unhandled, then the execution stops.\n    A try statement can have more than one except clause\n\nTry with Else Clause:\n---------------------\n    In python, you can also use the else clause on the try-except block which must be present after all the except clauses. The code enters the else block only if the try clause does not raise an exception.\n\nSyntax:\n\n    try:\n        # Some Code\n    except:\n        # Executed if error in the\n        # try block\n    else:\n        # execute if no exception\n    \nFinally Keyword in Python:\n----------------------------\nPython provides a keyword finally, which is always executed after the try and except blocks. The final block always executes after normal termination of try block or after try block terminates due to some exception.\n\nSyntax:\n\n    try:\n        # Some Code.... \n\n    except:\n        # optional block\n        # Handling of exception (if required)\n\n    else:\n        # execute if no exception\n\n    finally:\n        # Some code .....(always executed)\n\nRaising Exception:\n--------------------\n    The raise statement allows the programmer to force a specific exception to occur. The sole argument in raise indicates the exception to be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class that derives from Exception).\n    \n\n# Built-in Exceptions in Python\n--------------------------------------------\nAll instances in Python must be instances of a class that derives from BaseException.\nThere are several built-in exceptions in Python that are raised when errors occur. These built-in exceptions can be viewed using the local() built-in functions as follows :\n\n>>> locals()['__builtins__']\n\nThis returns a dictionary of built-in exceptions, functions and attributes.\n\nBase Classes:\n-----------------\n\nThe following exceptions are used mostly as base classes for other exceptions.\n\n1. exception BaseException:\n    This is the base class for all built-in exceptions. It is not meant to be directly inherited by user-defined classes. For, user-defined classes, Exception is used. This class is responsible for creating a string representation of the exception using str() using the arguments passed. An empty string is returned if there are no arguments.\n    * args : The args are the tuple of arguments given to the exception constructor.\n    * with_traceback(tb) : This method is usually used in exception handling. This method sets tb as the new traceback for the exception and returns the exception object.\n    \n Code :\n\n    try:\n        ...\n    except SomeException:\n        tb = sys.exc_info()[2]\n        raise OtherException(...).with_traceback(tb)\n        \n2. exception Exception\n    This is the base class for all built-in non-system-exiting exceptions. All user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.\n\n3. exception ArithmeticError\n    This class is the base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various arithmetic errors such as :\n    OverflowError\n    ZeroDivisionError\n    FloatingPointError\n    \n4. exception BufferError\n    This exception is raised when buffer related operations cannot be performed.\n\n5. exception LookupError\n    This is the base class for those exceptions that are raised when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid or not found. The exceptions raised are :\n    KeyError\n    IndexError\n\nConcrete exceptions:\n---------------------------\n\nThe following exceptions are the exceptions that are usually raised.\n\n1. exception AssertionError\n    An AssertionError is raised when an assert statement fails.\n    \n2. exception AttributeError\n    An AttributeError is raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails such as when a non-existent attribute is referenced.    \n\n3. exception EOFError\n    An EOFError is raised when built-in functions like input() hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data. The file methods like readline() return an empty string when they hit EOF.\n\n4. exception FloatingPointError\n    A FloatingPointError is raised when a floating point operation fails. This exception is always defined, but can only be raised when Python is configured with the–with-fpectl option, or the WANT_SIGFPE_HANDLER symbol is defined in the pyconfig.h file.\n    \n5. exception GeneratorExit\n    This exception directly inherits from BaseException instead of Exception since it is technically not an error. A GeneratorExit exception is raised when a generator or coroutine is closed.\n    \n6. exception ImportError\n    An ImportError is raised when the import statement is unable to load a module or when the “from list” in from … import has a name that cannot be found.\n\n7. exception ModuleNotFoundError\nThis is the subclass of ImportError which is raised by import when a module could not be found. It is also raised when None is found in sys.modules.\n\n8. exception IndexError\nAn IndexError is raised when a sequence is referenced which is out of range.\n\n9. exception KeyError\nA KeyError is raised when a mapping key is not found in the set of existing keys.\n\n10. exception KeyboardInterrupt\nThis error is raised when the user hits the interrupt key such as Control-C or Delete.\n\n11. exception MemoryError\nThis error is raised when an operation runs out of memory.\n\n12. exception NameError\nThis error is raised when a local or global name is not found. For example, an unqualified variable name.\n\n13. exception NotImplementedError\nThis exception is derived from RuntimeError. Abstract methods in user defined classed should raise this exception when the derived classes override the method.\n\n14. exception OSError([arg])\nThe OSError exception is raised when a system function returns a system-related error, including I/O failures such as “file not found” or “disk full” errors.\n\n15. exception OverflowError\nThe OverflowError is raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is out of range. Integers raise MemoryError instead of OverflowError. OverflowError is sometimes raised for integers that are outside a required range. Floating point operations are not checked because of the lack of standardization of floating point exception handling in C.\n\n16. exception RecursionError\nThe RecursionError is derived from the RuntimeError. This exception is raised when the interpreter detects that the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.\n\n17. exception ReferenceError\nThe ReferenceError is raised when a weak reference proxy is used to access an attribute of the referent after the garbage collection.\n\n18. exception RuntimeError\nThe RuntimeError is raised when no other exception applies. It returns a string indicating what precisely went wrong.\n\n19. exception StopIteration\nThe StopIteration error is raised by built-in function next() and an iterator‘s __next__() method to signal that all items are produced by the iterator.\n\n20. exception SyntaxError\nThe SyntaxError is raised when the parser encounters a syntax error. A syntax error may occur in an import statement or while calling the built-in functions exec() or eval(), or when reading the initial script or standard input.\n\n21. exception SystemError\nThe SystemError is raised when the interpreter finds an internal error. The associated value is a string indicating what went wrong.\n\n22. exception SystemExit\nThe SystemExit is raised when sys.exit() function is called. A call to sys.exit() is translated into an exception to execute clean-up handlers (finally clauses of try statements) and to debug a script without running the risk of losing control.\n\n23. exception TypeError\nTypeError is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. This exception returns a string giving details about the type mismatch.\n\n24. exception UnboundLocalError\nUnboundLocalError is a subclass of NameError which is raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been assigned to that variable.\n\n25. exception UnicodeError\nThis exception is a subclass of ValueError. UnicodeError is raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs.\n\n26. exception ValueError\nA ValueError is raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an invalid value.\n\n27. exception ZeroDivisionError\nA ZeroDivisionError is raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero. This exception returns a string indicating the type of the operands and the operation.\n\nException\tDescription\nIndexError\tWhen the wrong index of a list is retrieved.\nAssertionError\tIt occurs when the assert statement fails\nAttributeError\tIt occurs when an attribute assignment is failed.\nImportError\tIt occurs when an imported module is not found.\nKeyError\tIt occurs when the key of the dictionary is not found.\nNameError\tIt occurs when the variable is not defined.\nMemoryError\tIt occurs when a program runs out of memory.\nTypeError\tIt occurs when a function and operation are applied in an incorrect type.\nIOError: if the file can’t be opened\nKeyboardInterrupt: when an unrequired key is pressed by the user\nValueError: when built-in function receives a wrong argument\nEOFError: if End-Of-File is hit without reading any data\n\n\n\nCreating User-defined Exception:\n--------------------------------\n    Programmers may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class. Exceptions need to be derived from the Exception class, either directly or indirectly. Although not mandatory, most of the exceptions are named as names that end in “Error” similar to the naming of the standard exceptions in python.\n    \nDeriving Error from Super Class Exception:\n--------------------------------------------\n    Superclass Exceptions are created when a module needs to handle several distinct errors. One of the common ways of doing this is to create a base class for exceptions defined by that module. Further, various subclasses are defined to create specific exception classes for different error conditions.\n    \nNZEC error in Python:\n----------------------\n    While coding in various competitive sites, many people must have encountered NZEC errors. NZEC (non zero exit code) as the name suggests occurs when your code is failed to return 0. When a code returns 0 it means it is successfully executed otherwise it will return some other number depending on the type of error.\nWhen the program ends and it is supposed to return “0” to indicate if finished fine and is not able to do so it causes NZEC. Of course, there are more cases associated with NZEC.\n\nWhy does NZEC occur?(one example)\n\nIn python, generally, multiple inputs are separated by commas and we read them using input() or int(input()), but most of the online coding platforms while testing gives input separated by space and in those cases, int(input()) is not able to read the input properly and shows error like NZEC.\n\nHow to resolve?\n\nFor Example, Think of a simple program where you have to read 2 integers and print them(in input file both integers are in same line). Suppose you have two integers as shown below:\n    23 45\nInstead of using :\n\n    n = int(input())\n    k = int(input())\n    Use:\n\n    n, k = raw_input().split(\" \")\n    n = int(n)\n    k = int(k)\n    to delimit input by white spaces.\n\nSome prominent reasons for NZEC error:\n    Infinite Recursion or if you have run out of stack memory.\n    Input and output both are NOT exactly same as the test cases.\n    As the online platforms, test your program using a computer code which matches your output with the specified outputs exactly.\n    This type of error is also shown when your program is performing basic programming mistakes like dividing by 0.\n    Check for the values of your variables, they can be vulnerable to integer flow.\n    ",

A Container is an object that is used to store different objects and provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them. Some of the built-in containers are Tuple, List, Dictionary, etc.\n\n# Counters:\n===========\n    A counter is a sub-class of the dictionary. It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary where the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable.\n\nNote: It is equivalent to bag or multiset of other languages.\n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.Counter([iterable-or-mapping])\n\nInitializing Counter Objects:\nThe counter object can be initialized using the counter() function and this function can be called in one of the following ways:\n    With a sequence of items\n    With a dictionary containing keys and counts\n    With keyword arguments mapping string names to counts\n\nUpdation : \nWe can also create an empty counter in the following manner : \n    coun = collections.Counter()\nAnd can be updated via update() method .Syntax for the same : \n    coun.update(Data)\n\nData can be provided in any of the three ways as mentioned in initialization and the counter’s data will be increased not replaced.\nCounts can be zero and negative also. \nWe can use Counter to count distinct elements of a list or other collections. \n\n\n\n# OrderedDict:\n==============\nAn OrderedDict is also a sub-class of dictionary but unlike dictionary, it remembers the order in which the keys were inserted. \n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.OrderDict()\n    \nImportant Points: \n1. Key value Change: If the value of a certain key is changed, the position of the key remains unchanged in OrderedDict.\n2. Deletion and Re-Inserting: Deleting and re-inserting the same key will push it to the back/ last index as OrderedDict, however, maintains the order of insertion.\n\nOther Considerations:\n1. Ordered dict in Python version 2.7 consumes more memory than normal dict. This is due to the underlying Doubly Linked List implementation for keeping the order. In Python 2.7 Ordered Dict is not dict subclass, it’s a specialized container from collections module.\n2. Starting from Python 3.7, insertion order of Python dictionaries is guaranteed.\n3. Ordered Dict can be used as a stack with the help of popitem function. Try implementing LRU cache with Ordered Dict.\n\n\n# DefaultDict:\n================\nA DefaultDict is also a sub-class to dictionary. It is used to provide some default values for the key that does not exist and never raises a KeyError.\n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.defaultdict(default_factory)\n\n    default_factory is a function that provides the default value for the dictionary created. If this parameter is absent then the KeyError is raised.\n\nInitializing DefaultDict Objects\nDefaultDict objects can be initialized using DefaultDict() method by passing the data type as an argument.\n\nInner Working of defaultdict:\nDefaultdict adds one writable instance variable and one method in addition to the standard dictionary operations. The instance variable is the default_factory parameter and the method provided is __missing__.\n\n    Default_factory: It is a function returning the default value for the dictionary defined. If this argument is absent then the dictionary raises a KeyError.\n    \n    __missing__(): This function is used to provide the default value for the dictionary. This function takes default_factory as an argument and if this argument is None, a KeyError is raised otherwise it provides a default value for the given key. This method is basically called by the __getitem__() method of the dict class when the requested key is not found. __getitem__() raises or return the value returned by the __missing__(). method.\n    \nUsing List as default_factory:\nWhen the list class is passed as the default_factory argument, then a defaultdict is created with the values that are list.\n\nUsing int as default_factory:\nWhen the int class is passed as the default_factory argument, then a defaultdict is created with default value as zero.\n\n# ChainMap:\n===============\nA ChainMap encapsulates many dictionaries into a single unit and returns a list of dictionaries.\n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.ChainMap(dict1, dict2)\n    \nAccessing Keys and Values from ChainMap:\nValues from ChainMap can be accessed using the key name. They can also be accessed by using the keys() and values() method.\n    keys() :- This function is used to display all the keys of all the dictionaries in ChainMap.\n    values() :- This function is used to display values of all the dictionaries in ChainMap.\n    maps() :- This function is used to display keys with corresponding values of all the dictionaries in ChainMap.\nNote : If the same key is repeated in two dictionaries which are chainmapped, only the first dictionary key is taken to populate the value of key. Ordering is done as the dictionaries are passed in function.\n\nManipulating Operations:\nnew_child() :- This function adds a new dictionary in the beginning of the ChainMap.\nreversed() :- This function reverses the relative ordering of dictionaries in the ChainMap.\n\nAdding new dictionary:\nA new dictionary can be added by using the new_child() method. The newly added dictionary is added at the beginning of the ChainMap.\n\n# NamedTuple:\n==============\nA NamedTuple returns a tuple object with names for each position which the ordinary tuples lack. For example, consider a tuple names student where the first element represents fname, second represents lname and the third element represents the DOB. Suppose for calling fname instead of remembering the index position you can actually call the element by using the fname argument, then it will be really easy for accessing tuples element. This functionality is provided by the NamedTuple.\n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.namedtuple(typename, field_names)\n    \nConversion Operations:\n1. _make(): This function is used to return a namedtuple() from the iterable passed as argument.\n2. _asdict(): This function returns the OrdereDict() as constructed from the mapped values of namedtuple().\n3. using “**” (double star) operator :- This function is used to convert a dictionary into the namedtuple().\n\nAccess Operations:\n1. Access by index: The attribute values of namedtuple() are ordered and can be accessed using the index number unlike dictionaries which are not accessible by index.\n2. Access by keyname: Access by keyname is also allowed as in dictionaries.\n3. using getattr(): This is yet another way to access the value by giving namedtuple and key value as its argument.\n\nAdditional Operation:\n1. _fields: This function is used to return all the keynames of the namespace declared.\n2. _replace(): _replace() is like str.replace() but targets named fields( does not modify the original values)\n\n# Deque:\n==========\nDeque (Doubly Ended Queue) is the optimized list for quicker append and pop operations from both sides of the container. It provides O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list with O(n) time complexity.\n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.deque(list)\nThis function takes the list as an argument.\n\nInserting Elements:\nElements in deque can be inserted from both ends. To insert the elements from right append() method is used and to insert the elements from the left appendleft() method is used.\n\nRemoving Elements:\nElements can also be removed from the deque from both the ends. To remove elements from right use pop() method and to remove elements from the left use popleft() method.\n\n\nvarious Operations on deque : \n    append():- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the right end of the deque.\n    appendleft():- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the left end of the deque.\n    pop():- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of the deque.\n    popleft():- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of the deque.\n    index(ele, beg, end):- This function returns the first index of the value mentioned in arguments, starting searching from beg till end index.\n    insert(i, a) :- This function inserts the value mentioned in arguments(a) at index(i) specified in arguments.\n    remove():- This function removes the first occurrence of value mentioned in arguments.\n    count():- This function counts the number of occurrences of value mentioned in arguments.\n    extend(iterable):- This function is used to add multiple values at the right end of the deque. The argument passed is iterable.\n    extendleft(iterable):- This function is used to add multiple values at the left end of the deque. The argument passed is iterable. Order is reversed as a result of left appends.\n    reverse():- This function is used to reverse the order of deque elements.\n    rotate():- This function rotates the deque by the number specified in arguments. If the number specified is negative, rotation occurs to the left. Else rotation is to right.\n\n# UserDict:\n============\nUserDict is a dictionary-like container that acts as a wrapper around the dictionary objects. This container is used when someone wants to create their own dictionary with some modified or new functionality. \n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.UserDict([initialdata])\n    \n# UserList:\n=============\nUserList is a list like container that acts as a wrapper around the list objects. This is useful when someone wants to create their own list with some modified or additional functionality. It can be considered as a way of adding new behaviors to the dictionary. This class takes a dictionary instance as an argument and simulates a dictionary that is kept in a regular dictionary. The dictionary is accessible by the data attribute of this class.\n\n    Syntax:\n    class collections.UserList([list])\n    \n# UserString:\n==============\nUserString is a string like container and just like UserDict and UserList it acts as a wrapper around string objects. It is used when someone wants to create their own strings with some modified or additional functionality. \n    Syntax:\n    class collections.UserString(seq)\n\n# Heap Queue or Heapq in Python:\n==================================\n\nHeap data structure is mainly used to represent a priority queue. In Python, it is available using “heapq” module. The property of this data structure in Python is that each time the smallest of heap element is popped(min heap). Whenever elements are pushed or popped, heap structure in maintained. The heap[0] element also returns the smallest element each time.\n\nLet’s see various Operations on heap :\n1. heapify(iterable) :- This function is used to convert the iterable into a heap data structure. i.e. in heap order.\n\n2. heappush(heap, ele) :- This function is used to insert the element mentioned in its arguments into heap. The order is adjusted, so as heap structure is maintained.\n\n3. heappop(heap) :- This function is used to remove and return the smallest element from heap. The order is adjusted, so as heap structure is maintained.\n\n4. heappushpop(heap, ele) :- This function combines the functioning of both push and pop operations in one statement, increasing efficiency. Heap order is maintained after this operation.\n\n5. heapreplace(heap, ele) :- This function also inserts and pops element in one statement, but it is different from above function. In this, element is first popped, then the element is pushed.i.e, the value larger than the pushed value can be returned. heapreplace() returns the smallest value originally in heap regardless of the pushed element as opposed to heappushpop().\n\n6. nlargest(k, iterable, key = fun) :- This function is used to return the k largest elements from the iterable specified and satisfying the key if mentioned.\n\n7. nsmallest(k, iterable, key = fun) :- This function is used to return the k smallest elements from the iterable specified and satisfying the key if mentioned.",

It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve“. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.\n\nConcepts of Functional Programming\nAny Functional programming language is expected to follow these concepts.\n\n1. Pure Functions: These functions have two main properties. First, they always produce the same output for the same arguments irrespective of anything else. Secondly, they have no side-effects i.e. they do modify any argument or global variables or output something.\n\n2. Recursion: There are no “for” or “while” loop in functional languages. Iteration in functional languages is implemented through recursion.\n\n3. Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order: First-class functions are treated as first-class variable. The first-class variables can be passed to functions as a parameter, can be returned from functions or stored in data structures.\n\n4. Variables are Immutable: In functional programming, we can’t modify a variable after it’s been initialized. We can create new variables – but we can’t modify existing variables.",

      "cell_type": "raw",
      "source": "******************************* Functional Programming in Python ************************\nPython too supports Functional Programming paradigms without the support of any special features or libraries.\n\n* Pure Functions:\n------------------\nAs Discussed above, pure functions have two properties.\n\n    It always produces the same output for the same arguments. For example, 3+7 will always be 10 no matter what.\n    It does not change or modifies the input variable.\n\nThe second property is also known as \"immutability\". The only result of the Pure Function is the value it returns. They are deterministic. Programs done using functional programming are easy to debug because pure functions have no side effects or hidden I/O. Pure functions also make it easier to write parallel/concurrent applications. When the code is written in this style, a smart compiler can do many things – it can parallelize the instructions, wait to evaluate results when needing them, and memorize the results since the results never change as long as the input doesn’t change.\n\n* Recursion:\n--------------\nDuring functional programming, there is no concept of for loop or while loop, instead recursion is used. Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution to the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. A question may arise what is base case? The base case can be considered as a condition that tells the compiler or interpreter to exit from the function.\n\n* Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order:\n----------------------------------------------------\nFirst-class objects are handled uniformly throughout. They may be stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or used in control structures. A programming language is said to support first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class objects.\n\nProperties of first class functions:\n\n    A function is an instance of the Object type.\n    You can store the function in a variable.\n    You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.\n    You can return the function from a function.\n    You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, …\n    \n* Built-in Higher-order functions:\n----------------------------------\n\nTo make the processing of iterable objects like lists and iterator much easier, Python has implemented some commonly used Higher-Order Functions. These functions return an iterator that is space-efficient. Some of the built-in higher-order functions are:\n\n1. Map(): \nmap() function returns a list of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)\n    \n    Syntax: map(fun, iter)\n\n    Parameters:\n    fun: It is a function to which map passes each element of given iterable.\n    iter: It is a iterable which is to be mapped.\n\n    Return Type: Returns an iterator of map class.\n\n2. Filter(): \nThe filter() method filters the given sequence with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not.\n    \n    Syntax: filter(function, sequence)\n\n    Parameters:\n    function: a function that tests if each element of a sequence true or not.\n    sequence: sequence which needs to be filtered, it can be sets, lists, tuples, or containers of any iterators.\n\n    Return Type: returns an iterator that is already filtered.\n\n3. Lambda functions: \nIn Python, anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know that def keyword is used to define the normal functions and the lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions.\n    \n    Syntax:\n    lambda arguments: expression\n    \n    * This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.\n    * One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.\n    * You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.\n    * It has various uses in particular fields of programming besides other types of expressions in functions.\n    \n* Immutability:\n-------------------\nImmutability is a functional programming paradigm can be used for debugging as it will throw an error where the variable is being changed not where the value is changed. Python too supports some immutable data types like string, tuple, numeric, etc.\n\n\nDifference between Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming?\n============================================================================\nObject-oriented languages are good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things. This can be accomplished by adding new classes which implement existing methods, and the existing classes are left alone.\n\nFunctional languages are good when you have a fixed set of things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new operations on existing things. This can be accomplished by adding new functions which compute with existing data types, and the existing functions are left alone.\n\n\n",
